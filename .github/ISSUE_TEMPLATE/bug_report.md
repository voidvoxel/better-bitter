**Error log** ***(Required/Recommended)***
```
If the game crashes, this is required. Otherwise, this is recommended, but would make fixing the bug 10 times faster 😊 Please consider! All you need to do is copy and paste your log here where this text is. It's super easy! The log file can be located in your `.minecraft` folder, at `.minecraft/logs/latest.log` *(or `.minecraft\logs\latest` if you're on Windows 💕)* and you can just erase this text and copy and paste your log file here <33
```
