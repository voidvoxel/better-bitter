# Better Bitter (`0.1.0+1.21.1`)

Better Bitter is a mod about transforming ingredients into a variety of aesthetic, delicious, and useful recipes, including new beverages, foods, and potions. These recipes range from simple additions, such as alternative ingredients in potion recipes, seasonings and seasoning shakers for foods to add additional saturation points and potion effects, and more.

## Status Effects

### Ancient Knowledge

* The entity gains more experience than usual. The rate of experience gain scales linearly per level of [Ancient Knowledge *(Status Effect)*](#ancient-knowledge).
* All nearby hostile and neutral entities are marked. The range of marking scales linearly per level of [Ancient Knowledge *(Status Effect)*](#ancient-knowledge).
* Marked entities glow.
* Marked entities release a burst of wind upon death.
* **TODO:** Marked entities are slowed and weakened.

### Dematerialization

* Allows the entity to pass through solid blocks as if they were transparent.
* Does not allow the entity to pass through [Obsidian](), nor blocks made of [Obsidian]().
* Temporarily nullified by [Materialization *(Status Effect)*](#materialization).

### Materialization

* Temporarily nullifies [Dematerialization *(Status Effect)*](#dematerialization) while the entity is affected by [Materialization *(Status Effect)*](#materialization).
* Upon expiring, [Dematerialization *(Status Effect)*](#dematerialization) is no longer nullified.

## Potions

### Thick Potion

This potion is already in vanilla Minecraft. However, it's one of the far-lesser-known ones, and it serves as a base for a new type of potion added by this mod - [elixirs](#elixirs), such as the [Elixir of Dematerialization](#elixir-of-dematerialization) - similar to how the Awkward Potion serves as the base for all vanilla Status Effect potions, such as a Speed Potion.

## Elixirs

[Elixirs](#elixirs) are just like any other potion, and are even compatible with mods that use vanilla potions. The differences between a potion and an [elixir](#elixirs) aren't technical ones; the differences between them include:
* An [elixir](#elixirs) requires a [Thick Potion *(Potion)*](#thick-potion) as a base, making an [elixir](#elixirs) more expensive to brew than a potion.
* An [elixir](#elixirs) requires expensive *(and oftentimes rare)* ingredients, such as [Gilded Phantom Membrane (Item)*](#gilded-phantom-membrane).
* An [elixir](#elixirs) beholds knowledge to the entity, enchanting them with a magical spell for a short period of time. These powers are far greater than those granted by a potion.
* The Status Effects of an [elixir](#elixirs) last much longer than the Status Effects of a potion.
